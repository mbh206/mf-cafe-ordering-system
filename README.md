# Cafe Ordering System

A simple cafe ordering system built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates my skills in modern web development technologies.

## Features

- Browse available drinks with images and descriptions
- Add drinks to cart with quantity controls
- Increase/decrease quantities or remove items from cart
- Real-time cart total calculation
- Clean, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS

## Tech Stack

- **React** - Frontend framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Project Structure

- `src/cart/` - Cart component and functionality
- `src/drink-items/` - Drink display and selection components
- `src/data/` - Mock data for drinks
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/images/` - Drink images

## Note

This is a demonstration project - the purchase functionality currently shows an alert and doesn't process actual orders.
